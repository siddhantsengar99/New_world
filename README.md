# 🚦 Smart Road Sign Classifier using CNN

This project focuses on building an intelligent **road sign recognition system** using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**. It classifies different types of traffic signs from image datasets and provides real-time recognition capabilities using a webcam or video feed.

---

## 🧠 Project Overview

The **Smart Road Sign Classifier** aims to assist autonomous driving systems, driver-assistance technologies, and smart surveillance by automatically identifying road signs such as speed limits, turns, and warnings.

The project includes:

* CNN-based training pipeline for traffic sign recognition.
* Dataset handling utilities for preprocessing and augmentation.
* Real-time detection using OpenCV.
* Model saving/loading for future inference.
* Human-readable inference mapping (class → label).

## 🧩 How to Run the Project

### 🏋️ Train the Model

Ensure your dataset is correctly structured under `dataset/train` and `dataset/test`.
Then, run:

```bash
python train.py
```

This script:

* Loads and preprocesses images.
* Builds and trains the CNN.
* Saves the best performing model as `best_model.h5`.

---

### 🧾 Evaluate or Test

Once training is complete, you can evaluate:

```bash
python model.py
```

This will test the trained model on unseen data and report accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix.

---

### 📷 Real-Time Detection

Use your webcam to detect traffic signs in real time:

```bash
python realtime_detection.py
```

This script:

* Loads `traffic_sign_cnn.h5`
* Captures frames via OpenCV.
* Predicts and displays the detected sign label live on the screen.

---

## 🧭 Inference Mapping

The mapping between **class ID** and **human-readable labels** is defined in `labels.py`.
Example:

```python
class_labels = {
    0: "Speed Limit 20",
    1: "Speed Limit 30",
    2: "Speed Limit 50",
    3: "No Entry",
    4: "Stop",
    5: "Yield",
    6: "Turn Right",
    7: "Turn Left"
}
```

This ensures that model predictions (numeric outputs) are converted into meaningful road sign names.

## 🧰 Possible Improvements (To Make It Look Human-Generated)

You can make the project feel more original and research-oriented by:

* Adding **data augmentation** (rotation, brightness, zoom) in `data_utils.py`.
* Including **visualizations** of training accuracy/loss using Matplotlib.
* Writing **comments** in a human tone (e.g., explaining reasoning behind architecture choices).
* Creating a **comparison table** for different CNN architectures (LeNet, VGG, ResNet).
* Adding a **README badge** for dataset, accuracy, and Python version.
* Including a short **research motivation** in the introduction.
* Exporting the model as a `.tflite` file for mobile integration.
